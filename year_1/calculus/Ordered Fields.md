A type of [[Field|field]] which also contains the [[Orderings#Total Order|total ordering]] of the elements. 


Every pair of [[Supremum property|Dedekind-complete]] [[Ordered Fields|ordered fields]] are said to have a unique [[Homomorphism (algebraic)#Isomorphism|isomorphism]], and thus their elements have the exact same properties.
For example, since [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] are a [[Real Numbers#Dedekind-completeness|Dedekind-complete]] ordered field, you can manipulate them and compute with them, without knowing how they can be defined.
