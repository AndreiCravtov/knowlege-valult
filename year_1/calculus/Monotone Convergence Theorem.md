Monotone Convergence Theorem, also known as the fundamental axiom of analysis, states that [[Monotonic Sequences|monotonic sequences]] converge if and only if they are bounded. This can be viewed as a special case of the [[Supremum property|least-upper-bound property]] or be used directly to prove that [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] are a [[Cauchy Sequences#Complete Metric Spaces|complete metric space]].

# Formal definition
Let $a_{n}$ be a monotone sequence. Then we have: $$a_{n} \ \text{converges} \iff a_{n} \ \text{is bounded}$$
In particular, we say that: 
$$
\begin{gathered}
a_{n} \ \text{is non-decreasing} \implies a_{n} \to \infty \ \ \text{or} \ \ \lim_{ n \to \infty } a_{n} = sup \{ a_{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{N} \} \\
a_{n} \ \text{is non-increasing} \implies a_{n} \to -\infty \ \ \text{or}  \ \ \lim_{ n \to \infty } a_{n} = inf \{ a_{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{gathered}
$$
Where $inf$ and $sup$ are the [[Infimum and supremum|infimum and supremum]].
