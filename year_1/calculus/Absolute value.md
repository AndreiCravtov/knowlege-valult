The absolute value (or modulus) of [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], written as $|x|$ or $abs(x)$ is the non-negative value of $x$. If $x$ is negative then $|x|=-x$, if $x$ is positive or $0$, then $|x|=x$. This can be summarised by the following:
$$
|x|=
\begin{cases}
x, \ \ \ \ \ \ x \geq 0 \\
-x, \ \ \ x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
The absolute value is primarily defined for [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] but generalisations have been created for [[Complex Numbers|complex numbers]], [[Vector Space|vectors spaces]], [[Field|fields]], and many others.

# Properties with real numbers
The absolute value defined over [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] has a few properties that can be used for manipulating expressions.
- $|x|=\sqrt{ x^2 }$
- $|x|<a \iff -a < |x| < a$
- $|xy|=|x||y|$
- $|\frac{x}{y}|=\frac{|x|}{|y|}$
- $|x+y|\leq |x|+|y|$
- $|x-y|\geq ||x|-|y||$
