The limit of a [[Mathematical Functions|function]] is a description of it's behaviour *near* a particular input. This concept requires that the [[Mathematical Functions#Domains, co-domains, ranges|domain and range]] of the function are [[Metric Space|metric spaces]], since describing the idea of being *near* an input requires a notion of *distance*.

# Formal Definition
Let $(X,d_{X})$ and $(Y,d_{Y})$ be [[Metric Space|metric spaces]], and let $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$ be ***nonempty***. We can now define the various notions of ***limit*** on the function $f: A \to B$.

## Finite Limit at a Point
The idea behind *finite* limits at a point, is that as we get closer to a *particular input* of $f$, the output converges on some value that we call a limit. If $p \in X$ is a [[Accumulation Point|limit point]] of $A$, and we have some ***limit*** $L \in Y$, we say that $$\lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = L \iff \forall \varepsilon >0,\exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in A: \ \ 0 < d_{X}(x,p) < \delta \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L) < \varepsilon$$or alternatively, we can say that $f(x) \to L$ as $x \to p$. What this is saying is: to prove $f(x)$ approaches a limit $L$ at $p$, you must show that for any arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ I can pick, you must find some $\delta>0$ where, for all $x \in A$, if the distance between $x$ and $p$ is less than $\delta$, then the distance between $f(x)$ and $L$ is less that $\varepsilon$.

This definition is more ***general***, and *used much more*, compared to the [[#Deleted vs non-Deleted Limits|non-deleted limit]]. It is *used much more*, because you say that - for example - this function still has a limit at $x_{0}$:
![[Pasted image 20240208233350.png|400]]
But we cannot say that this function has a ***non-deleted*** limit at $x_{0}$.

### Intuition
Here is a visual way of understanding this concept:
```desmos-graph
left=-1; right=10;
top=15; bottom=-1;
---
(7.25,12.5) | hidden | black | label: `f(x)=2x, \ 1 \leq x \leq 6`

f(x)=2x | 1<=x<=6 | black


(-0.2, 7) | hidden | red | label: `L`
y=7 | x>0 | red
(-0.2, 10) | hidden | #990000 | label: `L + \varepsilon`
y=10 | x>0 | #990000 | dashed
(-0.2, 4) | hidden | #990000 | label: `L - \varepsilon`
y=4 | x>0 | #990000 | dashed

(3.5, -0.04) | hidden | blue | label: `p`
x=3.5 | y>0 | blue
(5, -0.04) | hidden | #000099 | label: `p + \delta`
x=5 | y>0 | #000099 | dashed
(2, -0.04) | hidden | #000099 | label: `p - \delta`
x=2 | y>0 | #000099 | dashed
```
We are provided with a range around $L$ (represented by $\varepsilon$) and we must produce a range around $p$ (represented by $\delta$), for which, so long as the $x$ you pick falls within the range generated by $\delta$, then we can guarantee that $f(x)$ falls within the range generated by $\varepsilon$.
In practice, it means that having a limit of $L$ at $p$ will get you you arbitrarily close to to the limit by picking incredibly small $\varepsilon$, and picking the $x$ that falls within the $\delta$ range.

### Deleted vs non-Deleted Limits
The above definition is the more general definition of *limits*, and it is called the ***deleted limit***. The reason it is called that is because $0 < d_{X}(x,p) < \delta$ suggests that we ***ignore*** the limit behaviour at $x=p$, and therefore $p$ is ***deleted***. For instance, we don't care if $p \in A$ or $p \notin A$. If $p \in A$, we don't care if $d_{Y}(f(p),L) < \varepsilon$ or $d_{Y}(f(p),L) \geq \varepsilon$.

On the other hand, for a ***non-deleted limit*** we write $d_{X}(x,p) < \delta$; the limit behaviour at $x=p$ is ***important***, and therefore $p$ is ***non-deleted***. More precisely: we expect that if $x=p$ then $f(p)=L$. The full definition is: $$\lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = L \iff \forall \varepsilon >0,\exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in A: \ \ d_{X}(x,p) < \delta \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L) < \varepsilon$$As mentioned before, the ***non-deleted limit*** is a *special case of* the ***deleted limit***. Therefore to turn a ***deleted limit*** into a ***non-deleted limit***, we must *additionally* prove that $p \in A \implies f(p)=L$. If $p \not\in A$, then ***deleted limit*** is equivalent to ***non-deleted limit***.

Limits are assumed to be ***deleted*** most of the time, because it allows us to say that certain functions still have a limit at $p$ even if $f(p) \neq L$. However, sometimes ***non-deleted limits*** are used because [[#Limit Composition Theorem|limit composition]] always works with them (assuming $p \in A$). This is because whenever $p \in A$, then $f$ becomes [[Continuity#Limit Definition|continuous]] at $p$:
$$
\begin{align}
\exists L \in Y: \ \ \lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = L &\iff \exists L \in Y, \forall \varepsilon >0,\exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in A: \ \ d_{X}(x,p) < \delta \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L) < \varepsilon \\
&\iff \exists L \in Y, \forall \varepsilon >0,\exists \delta > 0: \ \ d_{X}(p,p)=0 < \delta \implies d_{Y}(f(p),L) < \varepsilon \\
&\iff \exists L \in Y, \forall \varepsilon >0: \ \ d_{Y}(f(p),L) < \varepsilon \\
&\iff \exists L \in Y: \ \ d_{Y}(f(p),L) = 0 \\
&\iff \exists L \in Y: \ \ f(p) = L \\
&\iff \exists L \in Y: \ \ \lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = f(p) \\
&\iff \lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = f(p)
\end{align}
$$

### "Deleted Neighbourhood" condition
The [[#Finite Limit at a Point|above definition]] requires that $p \in X$ be a [[Accumulation Point|limit point]] of $A$. This is the *bare minimum* assumption for the idea of limits to work. It allows exotic functions such as: $$f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}; \ \ \ \ f(x) = x$$
to have meaningful limits. For example, we can say that $\lim_{ x \to 0 } f(x) = 0$, and other such statements. But, we notice that such a function is rather *exotic* and doesn't *behave* well. To exclude such functions from having a limit, the following requirement is introduced: $$\exists V_{p} \in \mathcal{N_{p}}: \ \ V_{p} \setminus \{ p \} \subseteq A$$
What that is saying, is that there must exist some [[Neighbourhood|neighbourhood]] within the [[Neighbourhood#Complete System of Neighbourhoods|complete system of neighbourhoods]] of $p$, so that it's [[Neighbourhood#Deleted Neighbourhood|deleted]] counterpart is contained within $A$. This is sometimes called the ***"deleted neighbourhood" condition***. This stronger condition implies that $p$ is a [[Accumulation Point|limit point]] of $A$, and also ***excludes*** *exotic* functions such as $f$, i.e. example, $\lim_{ x \to 0 } f(x)$ would not exist under this requirement.

This property is useful because when working with [[#Limit Composition Theorem|limit of a composite functions]], or [[Differentiation of Real Functions|derivatives]], etc., it grantees certain properties that you need, in order to prove fundamental theorems and results. It limits the analysis to only those functions that are "well behaved" enough to conform to those useful results. 

## Finite Limit at Infinity
The idea behind **finite limits at infinity** is that, *in the long term*, $f$ converges to some value we call a limit. For this concept to work we need a way of ***quantifying infinity*** - for that we need [[Real Numbers|real numbers]]. More specifically, we can ***only*** define *finite limits at infinity* when $X = \mathbb{R}$.
![[Pasted image 20240209232019.png|400]]
For some ***limit*** $L \in Y$, we can define the ***limit at positive infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to + \infty } f(x) = L&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon \\
&B: &&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon \\
&C: &&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>N \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon
\end{align}
$$
and the ***limit at negative infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to - \infty } f(x) = L&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<c \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon \\
&B: &&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-c \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon \\
&C: &&\iff \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-N \implies d_{Y}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon
\end{align}
$$
Though equivalent, these definitions are used for different things:
- $A$ - most convenient to work with, when trying to prove stuff
- $B$ - easier to visualise the definition and see the intentions behind it
- $C$ - the $+\infty$ definition ***is*** the definition of the [[Convergence of Sequences#Convergence to a Limit|convergence of sequences]]

***NOTE:*** we can define the ***limit at negative infinity*** in terms of the ***limit at positive infinity*** - and vice versa: 
$$\lim_{ x \to -\infty } f(x) = L \iff \lim_{ x \to +\infty } f(-x) = L$$

## Infinite Limit at a Point
The idea behind **infinite limits at a point** is that, as we get closer to a *particular input* of $f$, the output grows towards infinity. For this concept to work we need a way of ***quantifying infinity*** - for that we need [[Real Numbers|real numbers]]. More specifically, we can ***only*** define *infinite limits at a point* when $Y = \mathbb{R}$.
```desmos-graph
top=10; bottom=-10;
left=-3; right=3;
---

f(x)=(x^2)/(1-x^2) | red
x=1 | dashed | blue
x=-1 | dashed | blue
```

If $p \in X$ is a [[Accumulation Point|limit point]] of $A$, we can define the ***positive infinite limit at a point*** with $$\lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = +\infty \iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists\delta>0,\forall x \in A: \ \ 0<d_{X}(x,p) < \delta \implies f(x) > r$$or alternatively, we can say that $f(x) \to +\infty$ as $x \to p$. We can similarly define the ***negative infinite limit at a point*** with $$\lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = -\infty \iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists\delta>0,\forall x \in A: \ \ 0<d_{X}(x,p) < \delta \implies f(x) < r$$
***NOTE:*** the reason [[#Deleted vs non-Deleted Limits|non-deleted-style]] limit definitions aren't used here at all, is because they would require us to **extend** the [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] with infinity elements — unnecessary and unwanted. Namely, if $p \not\in A$ then the two are equivalent. If $p \in A$, then a **non-deleted** definition would imply $\forall r \in \mathbb{R}: \ f(p)>r$ or $\forall r \in \mathbb{R}: \ f(p)<r$. Those statements lead to a **contradiction** if we assume $Y=\mathbb{R}$; the only way to avoid it is to extend $\mathbb{R}$ with infinity — $\mathbb{R} \cup \{ +\infty, -\infty \}$ or $\mathbb{R}\cup \{ \infty \}$.

## Infinite Limit at Infinity
We can now mix and match the definitions of [[#Finite Limit at Infinity|limits at infinity]] and [[#Infinite Limit at a Point|infinite limits]] in various ways; we can only do this if $X=\mathbb{R}$ *and* $Y=\mathbb{R}$.

We can define the ***positive infinite limit at positive infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to + \infty } f(x) = +\infty &\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies f(x)>r \\
&B: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies f(x)>r \\
&C: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>N \implies f(x)>r
\end{align}
$$
and the ***negative infinite limit at positive infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to + \infty } f(x) = -\infty &\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies f(x)<r \\
&B: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>c \implies f(x)<r \\
&C: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x>N \implies f(x)<r
\end{align}
$$
and the ***positive infinite limit at negative infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to - \infty } f(x) = +\infty &\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<c \implies f(x)>r \\
&B: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-c \implies f(x)>r \\
&C: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-N \implies f(x)>r
\end{align}
$$
and the ***negative infinite limit at negative infinity*** with these *equivalent* definitions:
$$
\begin{align}
&A: &\lim_{ x \to - \infty } f(x) = -\infty &\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<c \implies f(x)<r \\
&B: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists c>0, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-c \implies f(x)<r \\
&C: &&\iff \forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall x \in A: \ \ x<-N \implies f(x)<r
\end{align}
$$
Though equivalent, these definitions are used for different things:
- $A$ - most convenient to work with, when trying to prove stuff
- $B$ - easier to visualise the definition and see the intentions behind it
- $C$ - the $x \to \pm\infty$ definition ***is*** the definition of the [[Convergence of Sequences#Convergence to Infinity|convergence of sequences]] to *positive* and *negative* infinities respectively

***NOTE:*** just as we could with [[#Infinite Limit at a Point|infinite limits at a point]], we can write the following equivalences: 
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{ x \to -\infty } f(x) = + \infty \iff \lim_{ x \to +\infty } f(-x) = +\infty \\ \\
\lim_{ x \to -\infty } f(x) = -\infty \iff \lim_{ x \to +\infty } f(-x) = -\infty
\end{align}
$$

# Composing Limits
## Limit Composition Theorem
We can deduce the limit of a [[Mathematical Functions#Function Composition|composite]] function, based on the limits of the functions being composed; sometimes certain requirements need to be met.

To describe these requirements, let us take the [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $(X,d_{X})$ and $(Y,d_{Y})$ and $(Z, d_{Z})$, and select the points $a \in X, b \in Y, c \in Z$. Now consider the functions $f: A \to B_{1}$ and $g: B_{2} \to C$, where $A \subseteq X$ and $B_{1},B_{2} \subseteq Y$ and $C \subseteq Z$. Now we define $A^+ = \{ \ x \in A \ | \ f(x) \in B \ \}$, which is the set of points $x$ for which $g(f(x))$ is defined. Hence we define $g \circ f: A^+ \to C; \ \ x \mapsto g(f(x))$ as the [[Mathematical Functions#Function Composition|composite function]].

Broadly speaking, here are the ways our limits can be composed:
$$
\begin{align}
1. && \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = \infty, \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(x)=c &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to a } g(f(x)) = c \\
2. && \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = \infty, \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(x)=\infty &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to a } g(f(x)) = \infty \\
3. && \lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = \infty, \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(x)=c &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(f(x)) = c \\
4. && \lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = \infty, \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(x)=\infty &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(f(x)) = \infty \\
5. && \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = b, \lim_{ x \to b } g(x)=c &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to a } g(f(x)) = c \\
6. && \lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = b, \lim_{ x \to b } g(x)=c &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to \infty } g (f(x)) = c \\
7. && \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = b, \lim_{ x \to b } g(x)=\infty &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to a } g(f(x)) = \infty \\
8. && \lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = b, \lim_{ x \to b } g(x)=\infty &&\implies&& \lim_{ x \to \infty } g(f(x)) = \infty \\
\end{align} 
$$
In the cases where $\lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = ??$ (i.e. $1$, $2$, $5$ and $7$), we require further that $a$ is an [[Accumulation Point|limit point]] of $A^+$, to ensure that the limit of $g \circ f$ can even exist. If the domain of $f$ contains a [[#"Deleted Neighbourhood" condition|deleted neighbourhood]] of $a$ then the prior requirement is automatically met.

With that, we can always compose $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ (assuming $X/Y/Z\text{ is }\mathbb{R}$, as needed).

Assuming that $g$ is [[Continuity#Limit Definition|continuous]] at $b$ allows us to compose $5$ and $6$.

Assuming that $\exists \delta>0,\forall x \in A: \ \ 0<d_{X}(x,a)<\delta \implies d_{Y}(f(x),b)>0$ (i.e. $f$ eventually *stops* taking the value $b$ [[Neighbourhood#Deleted Neighbourhood|near]] $a$), allows us to compose $5$ and $7$.

Assuming $\exists c \in\mathbb{R}, \forall x \in A: x>c \implies d_{Y}(f(x),b)>0$ (i.e. $f$ eventually *stops* taking the value $b$ [[Neighbourhood#Neighbourhood of Infinity of Reals|near infinity]]), allows us to compose $6$ and $8$.

We can ***visualise*** the conditions for limit $5$ by considering a case where composition ***fails*** at $x=0$:
```desmos-graph
left=-1; right=1;
top=2; bottom=-0.5;
---
(0.225,0.35) | hidden | red | label:`x \neq 0: \ f(x)=0`
(0.225,0.25) | hidden | red | label:`x=0: \ f(x)=1`

(-0.4,0.80) | hidden | blue | label:`x \neq 0: \ g(x)=2x^2-\frac{2}{5}`
(-0.4,0.65) | hidden | blue | label:`x=0: \ g(x)=-\frac{1}{5}`


y=0 | red
(0,1) | red
(0,0) | open | red

y=2x^2-0.4 | blue
(0,-0.2) | blue
(0,-0.4) | open | blue
```
We can see that $\lim_{ x \to 0 }f(x) =0$, $\lim_{ x \to 0 }g(x) = -\frac{2}{5}$ and $g(0) \neq -\frac{1}{5}$. We can ***also*** see that - no matter how close you get to $0$, $f$ will ***never*** stop taking the value $0$ [[Neighbourhood#Deleted Neighbourhood|near]] it. As a result we cannot ***necessarily*** say that $\lim_{ x \to 0 }g(f(x)) \ne -\frac{2}{5}$. For limit $6.$ similar examples can be constructed.

## Examples
Using the [[#Limit Composition Theorem|composition theorem]], we can derive a couple of useful results in the context of [[Real Numbers|real]] functions. If we have $f: A \to B_{1}$ and $g: A \to B_{2}$ — with $A,B_{1},B_{2} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and the numbers $\lambda, K,L \in \mathbb{R}$ then the following results hold:
$$
\begin{aligned}
1: \ & \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) = K &&\iff&& \lim_{ x \to X } \lambda f(x) &&= \lambda \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) &&= \lambda K \\
2: \ & \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) = K, \ \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) = L &&\iff&& \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) + g(x) &&= \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) + \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) &&= K + L \\
3: \ & \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) = K, \ \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) = L &&\iff&& \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) - g(x) &&= \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) - \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) &&= K - L \\
4: \ & \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) = K, \ \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) = L &&\iff&& \lim_{ x \to X } f(x)g(x) &&= \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) &&= KL \\
5: \ & \lim_{ x \to X } f(x) = K, \ \lim_{ x \to X } g(x) = L \neq 0 &&\iff&& \lim_{ x \to X } \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &&= \frac{\lim_{ x \to X } f(x)}{\lim_{ x \to X } g(x)} &&= \frac{K}{L}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where $X$ is a placeholder for a particular [[#Finite Limit at a Point|limit point]], or some kind of [[#Finite Limit at Infinity|infinity]].
