The supremum property (or least-upper-bound property) is a property that [[Partial Order|partially ordered sets]] can have. The supremum property one form of the [[Completeness of the Real Numbers|completeness axiom]] for [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], and is sometimes known as Dedekind-completeness.

# Formal definition
Consider some [[Partial Order|partially ordered set]] $P$. Now consider an arbitrary nonempty subset $S \subseteq P$, such that $S$ is bounded above (has an upper bound). If $S$ also has a [[Infimum and supremum|least upper bound]], then $P$ is said to have the supremum property.

# Examples
An example of sets with the supremum property is the [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], while an example of sets that don't posses the supremum property is the [[Rational Numbers|rational numbers]].
A simple demonstration that the set $\mathbb{Q}$ lacks this property is as follows:
1. Consider the subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ defined as $S \triangleq \{ \ s \in \mathbb{Q} \ | \ s^2 \leq 2 \ \}$.
2. The set $S$ has many possible upper bounds
3. The theoretical $sup(S)$ would be $\sqrt{ 2 }$
4. However $\sqrt{ 2 } \notin \mathbb{Q}$ therefore this theoretical value cannot be the supremum of $S$
5. Therefore $S$ does not have a supremum while still having upper bounds
6. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ does not possess the supremum property
