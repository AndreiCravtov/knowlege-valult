An ***accumulation point*** (or ***limit point*** or ***cluster point***), of a [[Metric Space#Metric Subspace|metric subspace]] $S \subseteq X$, is some point $x \in X$ around which the other points of $S$ *"accumulate"* or *"cluster"*. In other words, every [[Neighbourhood#Deleted Neighbourhood|deleted neighbourhood]] of $x$ contains at least one point from $S$. We can visualise this by imagining the points of $S$ as pebbles, and we randomly drop them on a table. The ***accumulation points*** would be the points around which our pebbles *cluster* together.

# Formal Definition
Let $S \subseteq X$ be a [[Metric Space#Metric Subspace|metric subspace]], and let $x \in X$ be some point. We call $x$ an ***accumulation point*** (or ***limit point*** or ***cluster point***) of $S$, if every [[Neighbourhood#Deleted Neighbourhood|deleted neighbourhood]] of $x$ contains at least one point from $S$. This can be succinctly described using $\mathcal{N_{x}}$ ([[Neighbourhood#Complete System of Neighbourhoods|system of neighbourhoods]] of $x$), like so: $$\forall V_{x} \in \mathcal{N_{x}}: \ \ \ \ V_{x} \setminus \{ x \} \cap S \ne \emptyset$$
The above definition is equivalent to the statement that: $x$ an ***accumulation point*** of $S$ *if and only if* there exists some [[Sequences|sequence]] $s_{n}: \mathbb{N} \to S \setminus \{ x \}$ such that it [[Convergence of Sequences#Convergence to a Limit|converges]] to $x$. This can be succinctly described like so: $$\text{$x$ is an} \ \underline{\textbf{accumulation point}} \ \text{of $S$} \ \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ \exists s_{n}: \mathbb{N} \to S \setminus \{ x \}: \ \ \lim_{ n \to \infty } s_{n} = x$$
