The concept of ***left*** and ***right*** limits is an extension of the [[Limit of a Function|limits]] of [[Real Numbers|real]] functions. The idea is that sometimes, even if the function doesn't have a limit, if you approach from the *left* or *right*, there might appear to be a limit. And thus, we can relax the definition a bit, to capture this.
For example, here is an image of a function where the ***left-sided*** and ***right-sided*** limits aren't the same:

# Formal Definition
Let $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function (where $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$).

Then, $f$ has a ***right-sided limit*** $R \in \mathbb{R}$ at $p \in \mathbb{R}$, if $(p, h) \subseteq A$ (for some $h>p$) and:
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in A: \ \ 0 < x-p < \delta  \implies |f(x)-R|<\varepsilon
$$
meaning that $f(x)\to R$ as $x\to p^+$, or alternatively: $$\lim_{ x \to p^+ } f(x) = R$$
Similarly, $f$ has a ***left-sided limit*** $L \in \mathbb{R}$ at $p \in \mathbb{R}$, if $(h, p) \subseteq A$ (for some $h<p$) and:
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in A: \ \ 0 < p-x < \delta  \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon
$$
meaning that $f(x)\to L$ as $x\to p^-$, or alternatively: $$\lim_{ x \to p^- } f(x) = L$$
These are the definitions for [[Limit of a Function#Finite Limit at a Point|finite limits]], but can be extended to be [[Limit of a Function#Finite Limit at a Point|infinite]] too.

***NOTE:*** the limit of a *real* function can only exist if the ***left-sided*** and ***right-sided*** limits exist, and are the same value. Or more symbolically: $$\lim_{ x \to p } f(x) = L \iff \lim_{ x \to p^+ } f(x) = \lim_{ x \to p^- } f(x) = L $$

# Intuition
Here is a visual way of understanding it:

(-0.2, 4) | hidden | #990000 | label: `L - \varepsilon`
y=4 | x>0 | #990000 | dashed

(3.5, -0.04) | hidden | blue | label: `p`
x=3.5 | y>0 | blue
(5, -0.04) | hidden | #000099 | label: `p + \delta`
x=5 | y>0 | #000099 | dashed
(2, -0.04) | hidden | #000099 | label: `p - \delta`
x=2 | y>0 | #000099 | dashed
```
We are provided with a range around $L$ (represented by $\varepsilon$), for the ***left-sided*** limit, we must produce a range to the left of $p$ (so from $p-\delta$ to $p$) for which, so long as the $x$ you pick falls within that range, then we can guarantee that $f(x)$ falls within the range generated by $\varepsilon$. 
Similarly for the ***right-sided*** limit, we must produce a range to the right of $p$ (so from $p$ to $p+\delta$) for which, so long as the $x$ you pick falls within that range, then we can guarantee that $f(x)$ falls within the range generated by $\varepsilon$.
So this means that having a ***left-sided*** limit means you can get arbitrarily close to $L$ *from the left*, and likewise for the ***right-sided*** limit.
