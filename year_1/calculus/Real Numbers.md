A real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity. The difference between two real numbers can be arbitrarily small, and can be represented by an infinite amount of decimal places. You can think of it as a cut in the number line.

The set of all real numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{R}$.

# Properties
## Ordered
The set $\mathbb{R}$ is [[Ordered Fields|linearly ordered]] meaning that for numbers $x$ and $y$ we have $x<y, \ y<x \ \text{or} \ y=x$.

## Dedekind-completeness
Real numbers are said to be [[Supremum property|Dedekind-complete]], a kind of [[Completeness of the Real Numbers|completeness]], which means that if any nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has an upper bound, it also has a least upper bound.
