In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), the **smoothness** of a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") is a property measured by the number of [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(mathematics) "Derivative (mathematics)") it has over some domain, called _differentiability class_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness#cite_note-1) At the very minimum, a function could be considered smooth if it is differentiable everywhere (hence continuous).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness#cite_note-2) At the other end, it might also possess derivatives of all [orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_derivation "Order of derivation") in its [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function"), in which case it is said to be **infinitely differentiable** and referred to as a **C-infinity function** (or �∞![C^{{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/971ed05871d69309df32efdfd2020128c9cf69d8) function).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness#cite_note-3)
