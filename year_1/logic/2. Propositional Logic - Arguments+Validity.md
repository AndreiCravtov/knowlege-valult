# Entailment
## Semantic entailment - $\models$
If $\large P$ ***semantically entails*** $\large Q$ (or logically entails), we write it as $\large P \models Q$. This means that in every [[1. Propositional Logic - Basics#Situations and Evaluation Functions|situation]] (or model, or interpretation) where $\large P$ is true, $\large Q$ is also true; independent of any particular system of formal rules or axioms. It's about the truth of the statements in all possible interpretations.

## Syntactic entailment - $\vdash$
If $\large P$ ***syntactically  entails*** $\large Q$, we write it as $\large P \vdash Q$. This indicates that $\large Q$ can be derived from $\large P$ using a series of ***logical rules*** and ***axioms*** within a formal system. It is about manipulating symbols and formulas according to the ***rules*** of a logical system.

When the ***axioms*** and ***logical rules*** are being defined, its common to write $\dfrac{P}{Q}$, while $\large P \vdash Q$ is reserved for  actual proofs; there is no fundamental difference between the two.
