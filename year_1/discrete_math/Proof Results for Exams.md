As per what the lecturer said, we are allowed to use the results proved in the lectures in the exam. Here is the enumeration of the notable results that don't need proof.

# 1 - Mathematical Reasoning
$$
\begin{gathered}
(P \implies Q) \iff (\neg Q \implies \neg P) \\
A \vee (B \wedge C) \iff (A \vee B) \wedge (A \vee C) \\
A \wedge (B \vee C) \iff (A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)
\end{gathered}
$$
# 2 - Sets
