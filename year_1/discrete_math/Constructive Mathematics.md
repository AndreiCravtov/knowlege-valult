This is a type of mathematics that differs from regular (classical) mathematics only by the fact that the [law of the excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle) is assumed to not hold. This means that proofs by contradiction of any kind are not allowed. Proofs that adhere to the rules of this type of maths are considered stronger as they rely on less assumptions (axioms).
