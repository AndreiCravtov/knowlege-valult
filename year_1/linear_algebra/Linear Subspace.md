A *linear subspace* is [[Vector Space|vector space]] that is a subset of some *larger* vector space.

# Formal Definition
Given some [[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$ over a [[Field|field]] $F$, we call $W \subseteq V$ a ***linear subspace*** if, under the operations of $V$, $W$ is a vector space over $F$.

Every vector space $V$ is equipped with two **trivial subspaces**: $\{ \pmb 0 \} \subseteq V$ and $V \subseteq V$.
