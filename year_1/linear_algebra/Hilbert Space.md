The motivation for ***Hilbert spaces*** comes from the fact that [[#Finite Dimensional Inner Product Space|finite dimensional inner product spaces]] are *really* well behaved; we can do all sorts of interesting analysis with them. Hilbert spaces bring this well-behaving nature to [[Vector Space#Dimension of Vector Space|infinite dimensions]], meaning that we won't have to worry about things exploding to infinity all the time.

# Formal Definition
A ***Hilbert Space*** is an [[Inner Product Space|inner product space]], which also a [[Cauchy Sequences#Complete Metric Spaces|complete metric space]] with respect to the [[Metric Space|metric]] *induced by the inner product:* $$d(\pmb u, \pmb v) = \lvert \lvert \pmb v - \pmb u \rvert  \rvert  = \sqrt{ \langle \pmb v - \pmb u, \pmb v - \pmb u \rangle }$$That is to say, all [[Cauchy Sequences|Cauchy sequences]] in the **Hilbert Space** $H$, also [[Convergence of Sequences#Convergence to a Limit|converge to a limit]] within $H$.

# Finite Dimensional Inner Product Space
A [[Vector Space#Dimension of Vector Space|finite-dimensional]] [[Inner Product Space|inner product space]] is automatically [[Cauchy Sequences#Complete Metric Spaces|complete]], and therefore it is an *example* of a *Hilbert Space*. As a result, it is *also* called a ***finite-dimensional Hilbert Space***.

Every *finite-dimensional inner product space* $H$, has an [[Basis of Vector Space#Orthonormal Basis|orthonormal basis]] (obtained by applying the [Gram-Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process) on a [[Basis of Vector Space#Existence|regular basis]]). And we know that under an orthonormal basis $\mathcal{B} = \{ \pmb {b_{1}}, \pmb {b_{2}}, \dots, \pmb {b_{n}} \}$, for $\pmb u, \pmb v \in H$: $$\langle \pmb u, \pmb v \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n \langle \pmb u, \pmb{b_{i}} \rangle \overline{\langle \pmb u, \pmb{b_{i}} \rangle}$$Which means that the study of every ***complex*** $H$ can be reduced to the study of $\mathbb{C}^n$ under the [complex dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Complex_vectors), and the study of every ***real*** $H$ can be reduced to the study of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Coordinate_definition).
