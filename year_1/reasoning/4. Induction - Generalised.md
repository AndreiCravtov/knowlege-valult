Induction can be extended to prove properties on *any* inductively defined ***sets***. Special cases include inductively defined ***relations***, and ***functions***; just prove the base case, and inductive steps.

# Sets and Relations
For any ***inductively defined set*** $\large S$ and any $\large P \subseteq S$, induction can prove $\large \forall s:S.P(s)$.

For any $\large S$, any ***inductively defined relation*** $\large R \subseteq S$, and any $\large P \subseteq S$, induction can prove $\large \forall s:S.[R(s) \to P(s)]$

# Functions
For any $\large S$, any $\large T$, any ***inductively defined function*** $\large f: S \to T$, and any $\large P \subseteq S \times T$, induction can prove $\large \forall s:S. \forall t:T.[f(s) = t \to P(s,t)]$. It is important to note that $\large f$ will often be ***multivariate***, so elements of $\large S$ will be ***tuples***, i.e. $\large f(a,b)=c \to P(a,b,c)$ . 

Unlike [[#Sets and Relations|sets and relations]], functions are a *more tricky*, since they come in the form of ***recursive definitions***:

These ***recursive definitions*** must be converted to ***inductive definitions***:

Which can now be used to derive an ***inductive principle***:
![[Pasted image 20240417011653.png]]
The key idea here is to express the function ***in terms of it's recursive dependency***, assuming that it is met. Then replace all instances of the function equality with the ***property*** you are trying to prove, to get the ***inductive principle***.
## Limitations
You ***cannot*** prove ***termination*** of a function by induction, because induction assumes that the function terminates. The upside of this limitation, is that the function ***doesn't need to always terminate***.
